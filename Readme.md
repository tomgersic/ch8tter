###Description
This is a sample/demo project that accompanies a series of Model Metrics blog posts on the subject of developing mobile apps for Salesforce.com on Windows 8. 

Please note that this code is *not intended to be a production application*. Many features are implemented only to the extent required to show how they could work in a full-fledged production application, but are missing important things like error handling, documentation, and unit tests. Use this project at your own risk, but I hope you learn from it!

###Features
* OAuth 2.0

###Dependencies
* [Json.NET][1] version 4.5.10 -- installed via NuGet
